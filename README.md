# IAB330-Mobile-Application-Development
This is a university project about Making an app.

Our app is called Tconnect and it is designed to intergrate yammer contacts with events.

There are also several older builds in the main directory to help archive our progress. 
The higher the number the newer and more advanced the build.

Current Version: com.adhesivetech.tconnect.1_?.apk

Different letter builds are bug workarounds for a couple of phones. There is a bug with timezones and the database. Current workaround is adding the lost time.
Three variants of the bug as per the final builds 
- _a requiring +10:00 on Saving Events and +20:00 on Importing Events
- _b requiring +00:00 on Saving Events and +20:00 on Importing Events
- _c requiring +00:00 on Saving Events and +10:00 on Importing Events
*please switch build accordingly.
