# IAB330-Mobile-Application-Development
This is a university project about Making an app.

Our app is called Tconnect and it is designed to intergrate yammer contacts with events.

*Hopefully* the version your seeing our finished beta version.

There are also several older builds in the main directory to help archive our progress. 
 - The higher the number the newer and more advanced the build.
 - Different letter builds are bug workarounds for a couple of phones.
